This website was build with lots of love in many, many sleepless nights. It
took me in truth years to get to this point, where I am finally completely 
happy and proud of this personal piece of web design.

After building four different web sites over time with varying technologies I
settled in the end with the following:

* Jekyll as blogging software
* A subset of Bootstrap as Frontend framework
* SCSS as CSS preprocessor
* Adobe Typekit as web fonts distributor
* A Gulp / NPM / Browsersync combination for development, asset management and 
  build automation
