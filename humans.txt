This website was build with lots of love in many, many sleepless nights. It
took me in truth years to get to this point, where I'm finally happy and proud
of this personal piece of web design.

After building four different web sites and starting all over again and again
with varying technologies and design approaches, I settled in the end with the
following:

* Jekyll as blogging software
* A small subset of Bootstrap as frontend framework
* SCSS as CSS preprocessor
* Adobe Typekit for web fonts (Calluna)
* A Gulp / NPM / Browsersync combination for development, asset management and 
  build automation
